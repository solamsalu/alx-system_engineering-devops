# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** August 9, 2023, 10:00 AM - August 10, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC)\
**Impact:** The main website service experienced intermittent downtime, resulting in slow response times and partial unavailability. Users reported difficulties accessing the website, and approximately 30% of the user base was affected.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased response time and intermittent failures.
- The operations team was alerted and initiated investigations into the root cause.
- Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to a recent deployment or increased traffic.
- Several logs and system metrics were analyzed, focusing on the load balancer, application servers, and database.

## Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths

- Initial investigations pointed towards a potential database performance issue, leading to optimizations in database queries and indexing.
- Additional resources were provisioned to handle increased traffic, assuming it might be the cause of the slowdown.
- Logs were thoroughly examined for any anomalies, but no conclusive evidence was found.

## Escalation

- As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the development team responsible for the website's backend infrastructure.
- The engineering manager and senior developers were included in the incident response.

## Resolution

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfigured caching layer within the web server configuration. The cache was constantly being invalidated, resulting in frequent cache misses and subsequent heavy load on the application servers.

### Resolution Steps

The misconfiguration was rectified by updating the caching configuration to ensure proper cache handling and prevent unnecessary cache invalidation. The cache expiration time was also adjusted to strike a balance between fresh content delivery and reducing load on the application servers.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents in the future and improve the overall stability and performance of our web stack, we have planned the following measures:

1. **Improve Monitoring and Alerting Systems:** Enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to provide more granular insights into web server configurations, caching mechanisms, and response times.

1. **Implement Automated Testing and Validation:** Introduce automated testing and validation procedures for web server configurations during the deployment process. This will help catch misconfigurations before they impact production.

1. **Establish Performance Testing and Profiling:** Set up regular performance testing and profiling to identify system bottlenecks and optimize system components proactively.

1. **Develop a Comprehensive Incident Response Plan:** Create a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines clear responsibilities and escalation paths. This will ensure an efficient and coordinated response during future incidents.

1. **Conduct Post-Incident Reviews:** Conduct thorough post-incident reviews to share lessons learned and improve our incident response processes continuously.

## Tasks

To address the above corrective and preventative measures, the following tasks have been identified:

1. Patch the web server software to the latest stable version.
1. Implement robust monitoring and alerting for web server configuration parameters, cache hits/misses, and response times.
1. Create automated tests to validate web server configurations during the deployment process.
1. Set up automated performance testing and profiling to identify system bottlenecks.
1. Review and update the incident response plan, including clear responsibilities and escalation paths.

By diligently executing these tasks, we aim to enhance the stability, performance, and resilience of our web stack. Our goal is to provide a better user experience while minimizing the impact of any future incidents.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this outage and appreciate your patience and understanding. We remain committed to providing a reliable and efficient service.
